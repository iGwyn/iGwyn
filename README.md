<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Kreyz</h1>
<h3 align="center">Coding... Meh, Not My Thing 🙃</h3>

- ✨ **Selling Game Sources**:  
  I have some server and Unity-based client game sources available for sale. These include popular multi-platform games like **Ninja School Online**, **Ngoc Rong Online**, and **Avatar**. Why code new stuff when you can sell what already works, right?

- ☑️ **Why I Code?**:  
  To get it done and move on. Honestly, I’d rather be anywhere else.

- 🛠️ **Custom Development Services**:  
  I have a team that can code the product you need. Let us know what you’re looking for!

- 📧 **Reach Me**:  
  If you’re interested in buying game sources or discussing work opportunities, email me at **syhanhcbq@gmail.com**.

### Final Words:

Code is a means to an end. If there’s an easier way to achieve the same result, let’s take it. Life’s too short to obsess over syntax.
